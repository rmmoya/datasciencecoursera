## Summary of the data

The data to be analyzed corresponds to the ToothGrowth dataset from R datasets package and represents the effect of vitamin C on tooth growth in Guinea Pigs.

The response is the length of odontoblasts (cells responsible for tooth growth) in 60 guinea pigs. Each animal received one of three dose levels of vitamin C (0.5, 1, and 2 mg/day) by one of two delivery methods, orange juice or ascorbic acid (a form of vitamin C and coded as VC).
